[The Echo Nest Remix API][echo-nest-remix] for JavaScript.

This library implements a subset of the remix API using JavaScript and Flash. It provides

 * a simple interface to load and analyze tracks using The Echo Nestâ€™s API
 * a set of JavaScript classes to help write scripts that generate remixes using analysis data
 * a Flash player that can play generated remixes in real time

Running
=======

To run locally in your browser, you will need to instruct Flash to trust the
files. Use the [Global Security Settings manager][global-security-settings] to
